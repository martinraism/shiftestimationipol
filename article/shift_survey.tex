% IPOL class is based on the standard LaTeX article class is used
% essentially in the same way. The layout must not be changed. Special
% IPOL commands are used to set the title, authors and abstract.

\documentclass{ipol}

% Do not use math notations and greek letters in the title.
\ipolSetTitle{A survey on shift estimation methods for image registration}

% Author names must be separated with commas (,), not "and" or "&".
\ipolSetAuthors{Martin Rais \ipolAuthorMark{1},
                Second Author\ipolAuthorMark{2}}

% Affiliations must contain the department, institution and country.
% Use a professional email address (no gmail, yahoo, etc).
% Do not add postal address.
\ipolSetAffiliations{%
\ipolAuthorMark{1} CMLA, ENS-Cachan, France
                   (\texttt{martin.rais@cmla.ens-cachan.fr})\\

% IPOL encourages authors to do joint submissions to IPOL and
% SIIMS (SIAM Journal of Imaging Science). Upon acceptance, cross
% references are placed between both articles. The environment
% ipolSIIMS is used to set the standard header, before the
% abstract. Uncoment these lines if you prepare an IPOL+SIIMS article:

%\begin{ipolSIIMS}
%This IPOL article is related to a companion publication in the SIAM
%Journal on Imaging Sciences:\\
%Author Names, ``Article Title.''
%\textsl{SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences}, vol.~X, no.~X,
%pp.~N--M, YYYY. \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/XXXXXXXXX}
%\end{ipolSIIMS}

% The abstract of an IPOL article must be informative and summarize all
% important parts of the article. 

\begin{ipolAbstract}
The problem of global subpixel shift estimation appears frequently on several applications
related to image processing. When  high accuracy is not required, most authors tend to
use the well-known cross-correlation method which usually meets the performance
requirements for such tasks. However, under more demanding accuracy constraints,
cross-correlation approaches are either not accurate enough or their computational
costs are prohibitive. Moreover, problems such as time constraints, varying illumination
conditions, aliasing, among several others, make the shift estimation task harder.
What is worse, there is little evidence about which shift estimation method to use
depending on the circumstances. Our objective in this article is therefore to give an
in depth study on shift estimation methods, offering a practical recipe showing 
which methods are more suited depending on the conditions of the task. By discretizing 
the distinct varying conditions, we evaluate on each of them more than a thousand 
variants of shift estimation methods, and summarize the results here. We observed that 
gradient-based shift estimation methods, used in a multi-scale and iterative form, 
achieve in general the most accurate results, without requiring considerable 
computational resources. 
\end{ipolAbstract}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use the source code info to briefly explain what can be found as
% software code in the IPOL article.
% Do not use the phrasing "...the IPOL web part of this article."

\begin{ipolCode}
The source code section briefly explains what the source code
published with the article contains, all in a single paragraph. For
example: The reviewed source code and documentation for this algorithm
are available from \href{\ipolLink}{the web page of this
  article}. Compilation and usage instruction are included in the
\verb|README.txt| file of the archive.
\end{ipolCode}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use the supplementary files info to add explanations about other
% files published with the article.

\begin{ipolSupp}
The supplementary files section provides explanations about other
files published with the article, all in a single paragraph. Mention
clearly if they are reviewed or not. For example: A reference dataset,
to be used for further comparisons, is provided with the article and
peer-reviewed. A Matlab interface (not reviewed) is also available for
convenience.
\end{ipolSupp}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% All papers need key words. Key words are lowercase except for proper
% names and acronyms, and separated with commas. Only use plain text.

\ipolKeywords{first, second, third, fourth}

\subsection{Copyright}

Authors must warrant to be the authors of every part of the final
article including the images, or must include permission of the
copyright holder. If you use images you do not own, you must include
their authors and permissions to be used in the article in a special
section at the end of the article. We want other researchers to be
able to reuse these images for comparisons in other articles; try to
use only images under a permissive license like ``CC-BY'' or ``CC0''.

\section{References}

\bibliographystyle{siam}
\bibliography{refs}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Acknowledgment}

Include an acknowledgment of grant and funding organizations at the
end of the article. For example: This work was partially funded by the
ONR grant 1234ABCD, ERC grand 5678XYZ, and Treilles Foundation.

\section*{Image Credits}

You must mention the origin of \emph{every} image included in the article,
with their authors and license. Use a small font size for this
section, and set the heigh of the thumbnails to \verb|2em|. For example:\\
